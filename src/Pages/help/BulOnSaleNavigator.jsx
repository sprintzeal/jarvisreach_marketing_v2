                      profile. It is important to note that only one credit will
                      be deducted per contact, irrespective of the number of

                      available) at no extra cost.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Credit Consumption: </strong> Each API call
                      consumes one credit, but only if it returns results. This
                      means that if you make an API call and there are no
                      results, your credit balance remains unchanged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Daily Rate Limits:</strong> Regardless of whether
                      the API call returns results, each call contributes to the
                      daily rate limit. It's important to know that the rate
                      limit is separate from credit usage and is based on the
                      number of calls you make within a 24-hour period.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Starter and Advanced Plans:</strong> In both
                      plans, the daily rate limit is set at 600 API calls. This
                      means you can make up to 600 calls per day without
                      exceeding the limit.

                    <p>
                      If you need to exceed the daily API call limits of the
                      Starter or Advanced plans, the only plan that offers a
                      higher limit is the{" "}

                      We offer a convenient monthly plan whereby new credits are
                      allocated at the start of each billing cycle. However any

                      For clients subscribed to our semi-annual plans, we
                      provide fresh credits at the beginning of every six-month
                      cycle, so you can utilize them according to your
                      requirements without any time constraints. It is important
                      to note, however, that any credits left unutilized at the
                      end of the cycle will expire and cannot be carried forward
                      to the next cycle.

                      it will be necessary to upgrade to a paid plan, which

                      <strong>Credit Consumption: </strong> Each API call
                      consumes one credit, but only if it returns results. This
                      means that if you make an API call and there are no

                    <p>
                      Jarvis Reach charges one credit every time it successfully
                      retrieves at least one email address for a LinkedIn
                      profile. It is important to note that only one credit will
                      be deducted per contact, irrespective of the number of
                      email addresses found.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Additionally, our paid account holders are entitled to
                      access company details and mobile phone numbers (if
                      available) at no extra cost.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                    <p>
                      Furthermore, when contacts are added using LinkedIn URLs,
                      our credit valuation process remains consistent. Credits
                      are only consumed when a valid URL is provided and the
                      associated LinkedIn profile contains at least one email
                      address.

                    <h3>Understanding How Credits are Charged</h3>
                    <span>Updated over a week ago</span>
                    <p>
                      Jarvis Reach charges one credit every time it successfully
                      retrieves at least one email address for a LinkedIn
                      profile. It is important to note that only one credit will
                      be deducted per contact, irrespective of the number of
                      email addresses found.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Additionally, our paid account holders are entitled to
                      access company details and mobile phone numbers (if
                      available) at no extra cost.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <div className="common-credit">
                    <h4>
                      To recap: One credit equals one contact with one or more
                      emails (phones are not charged)
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                      Furthermore, when contacts are added using LinkedIn URLs,
                      our credit valuation process remains consistent. Credits
                      are only consumed when a valid URL is provided and the
                      associated LinkedIn profile contains at least one email
                      address.

                      How Credits and Daily Rate Limits Work with API Calls
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Credit Consumption: </strong> Each API call
                      consumes one credit, but only if it returns results. This
                      means that if you make an API call and there are no
                      results, your credit balance remains unchanged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Daily Rate Limits:</strong> Regardless of whether
                      the API call returns results, each call contributes to the
                      daily rate limit. It's important to know that the rate
                      limit is separate from credit usage and is based on the
                      number of calls you make within a 24-hour period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Starter and Advanced Plans:</strong> In both
                      plans, the daily rate limit is set at 600 API calls. This
                      means you can make up to 600 calls per day without
                      exceeding the limit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you need to exceed the daily API call limits of the
                      Starter or Advanced plans, the only plan that offers a
                      higher limit is the{" "}

                      </strong>{" "}
                      This plan is designed for users who require more
                      flexibility with a larger daily call capacity.

                      Our system automatically detects the duplication and you
                      are not charged again. Profiles are not duplicated, and

                    <p>
                      We offer a convenient monthly plan whereby new credits are
                      allocated at the start of each billing cycle. However any
                      unused credits will expire at the end of the cycle and
                      will not be carried forward.

                    <p>
                      For clients subscribed to our semi-annual plans, we
                      provide fresh credits at the beginning of every six-month
                      cycle, so you can utilize them according to your
                      requirements without any time constraints. It is important
                      to note, however, that any credits left unutilized at the
                      end of the cycle will expire and cannot be carried forward
                      to the next cycle.

                      In the event of a subscription termination, all premium
                      features will become restricted, reverting to the
                      limitations of a free account. This means that certain

                      industry, emails, and phone numbers. This ensures that all
                      the profiles you add remain 'fresh' and accurate.

                      it will be necessary to upgrade to a paid plan, which
                      offers phone number refresh as an additional feature.
